\alias{mergePTMAbundance}
\title{Merge the original and PTM versions of the proteins.}
\usage{
mergePTMAbundance(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe with the abundance of the different molecules over time (from \code{\link{simulateInSilicoSystem}}
or \code{\link{simulateParallelInSilicoSystem}}).}
}
\value{
A dataframe in which the abundance of original and modified versions of a protein have been merged to give the abundance of the protein (without distinction of its post-translational modification state).
}
\description{
Merge (i.e. sum) the abundance of the original and modified (PTM) versions of each protein in the results of a simulation.
}

sim = simulateInSilicoSystem(mysystem, mypop, 100)
